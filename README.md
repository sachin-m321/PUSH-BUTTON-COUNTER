Description :

This program creates a simple counter system using an Arduino, two pushbuttons, and an LCD display. The first button increases the count by 10, while the second decreases it by 10. The current count is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen, with a ">" symbol for incrementing and "<" for decrementing. The program includes basic debouncing with short delays to prevent multiple changes from a single button press. It uses the prestate variable to ensure that the count only updates once per press. This project demonstrates basic interaction with hardware components and is a good starting point for beginners.
